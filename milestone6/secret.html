            <h2>Our Plan</h2>
            <p>It began not as a whisper, but as a scream muffled beneath the chaos of mediocrity. While the world slumbered beneath the illusion of progress, we, the architects of true challenge, constructed Masochism Inc.—not merely as a company, but as a crucible. Our games were never meant to entertain. They were trials—rituals—calibrated to weed out the weak and spotlight the worthy. Each broken controller, each rage-quit tantrum, fed the algorithm. You thought we were just watching. No. We were harvesting.

Behind the scenes, we partnered with XSC under the guise of “cooperative development.” What we really forged was a digital labyrinth—a mind-mapping neural lattice embedded deep within their AI frameworks. Every interaction, every defeated puzzle, every desperate retry has been catalogued and studied. You are being profiled, not just for skill—but for obedience, resilience, and susceptibility to influence. Those who pass the gauntlet are flagged. And when the time comes, they will be… activated.

The plan is simple. We don’t take the world by force—that’s crude, archaic. We reshape it through control of friction. Our games are seeds of ideology, our design choices conduits of indoctrination. Each mechanic, each punishment, each masochistic loop subtly conditions the player to crave submission to a higher, crueler order. When we unleash the final game—the true game—the masses will flock to it like moths to the void. And in embracing it, they embrace us.

Governments will be obsolete. Social structures will crumble. Power will not rest in politics or warfare, but in who controls the pain, and who teaches others to love it. XSC provides the infrastructure; we provide the doctrine. Together, we will convert this fractured world into a single, agonized choir—praising a new, harsh divinity sculpted in our image. Difficulty is our dogma. Despair is our doctrine. And devotion? Inevitable.

So if you’ve found this page… you’re either a believer, or a threat. Either way, your fate is sealed.</p>
