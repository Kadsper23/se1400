            <h2>Our Origins</h2>
            <p>Masochism Inc. was not born in a boardroom. It was summoned—invoked—in a midnight ritual of anguish, coffee-stained keyboards, and the electric hum of stubborn ambition.

                In the year of digital suffering, when games became safe, sterile, and soft, we emerged as a rebellion. We were tired of hand-holding tutorials and triumph handed out like candy. So we swore an oath: no easy paths. Only pain, perseverance, and pixel-perfect punishment.
                
                Our founding members were dreamers, yes—but dreamers with a taste for chaos. Coders who wrote spaghetti not by accident, but on purpose. Artists who drew worlds that smiled at your misfortune. Designers who didn’t balance difficulty—they weaponized it.
                
                Our first prototypes were broken, cruel, and laughed in the face of feedback. And we loved them. Because they fought back. Because they demanded blood, patience, and obsession. Every crash was a lesson. Every rage-quit, a baptism.
                
                We didn’t seek an audience. We summoned acolytes. Players who wanted to suffer. Players who whispered, “One more try,” even as their will frayed. From that sacred bond, a cult was born. A cult that grew.
                
                Today, we still wear our scars with pride. We don’t chase trends—we chase torment. And those brave enough to join us don’t ask for mercy. They ask for more.
                
                Welcome, initiate. You are now part of something beautifully cruel.</p>

        <div id="first-game">
            <h2>Our First Game</h2>
                <p>Cryptic Cabin was our first offering, our maiden curse. Forged in sleepless nights and cursed with logic that bends the mind, it was the proving ground for everything Masochism Inc. stands for.

                You awaken alone, locked inside a rotting wooden cabin hidden deep in the woods. No explanation. No map. Just the creak of old floorboards and the gnawing sense that you’re being watched. Somewhere beyond the splinters and shadows, cryptids—twisted creatures of myth and madness—lurk. They are drawn to movement. To sound. To mistakes.
                
                Your only chance? Solve a gauntlet of devious puzzles. No hints. No hand-holding. Every drawer could hide a clue... or a claw. Each solved riddle buys you precious time. Each failure brings them closer.
                
                Designed to punish complacency and reward obsession, Cryptic Cabin was our declaration of war against mediocrity. It dared players to think differently—to pay attention, to slow down, to suffer intelligently. And in return, it gave them the addictive high of earning every inch of progress.
                
                It wasn’t just a game. It was a trap. A beautiful, brutal trap. And those who escaped it didn’t just survive—they were transformed.
                
                Cryptic Cabin built the cult. It whispered to the masochists hiding among the masses and made them feel seen.
                
                To this day, the Cabin still stands. Waiting for the next fool brave enough to enter.</p>

            <h2>Our Trials</h2>
                <p>The path to pain is never paved. It’s carved—by missteps, failures, and the relentless grind of iteration. From the moment Masochism Inc. was born, we knew we weren't making games. We were forging experiences—ones that reject convenience, that punish carelessness, that reward only the obsessed.
                We broke engines. We lost builds. We fought syntax demons and stared into the abyss of unsolvable logic errors at 3:47 AM. We launched prototypes that crashed on startup. We watched testers weep in confusion, then rage-quit in catharsis. We watched players feel something—and that told us we were on the right path.
                
                But beyond the technical torments were deeper trials. Self-doubt. Creative burnout. The temptation to compromise—to make things easier, more "fun," more marketable.
                
                “Just add a tutorial,” they said. “Make it more accessible,” they said. “You’ll make more money,” they said.</p>
                
                    <a style=color:#F44336 href="pent.html"><h3>We refused.</h3></a>
                
                <p>Every obstacle became a test of our devotion. Every failure, a sermon. Through fire and frustration, we became sharper. Meaner. More intentional. Our games are hard because life is hard. And we believe games should respect their players enough not to lie to them.
                
                We could’ve taken shortcuts. But we chose the long, winding trail through madness—and in doing so, found our truest selves.
                
                These tribulations didn’t break us. They built the cult.</p>
